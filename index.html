            <p class="p">
                As you can read above, my name is Jacob Letourneau. Currently I am studying code, but I originally studied photography for
                four years.I graduated from Colby-Sawyer College in 2015 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in studio art.
                I enjoy photography due to the idea of capturing moments in time that no one else will likely see again.
                They will see scenes or sujects that are similar but it will never be exactly the same. Playing with light
                is another part of photography that interests me. I love adding lights to the subject to give it a mystical
                or unworldly feeling.
            </p>

            <p class="p">
                What brings me to coding is simply that it has interested me for a while now and I only recently have been given an opportunity
                to learn this unique skill that I can use to better myself in the future. Whether I go into coding as a career,
                do freelance coding, or just use it as a hobby I can not say at this time. I can say though that I am very
                fond of coding thus far and I am interested to see where it will bring me.
